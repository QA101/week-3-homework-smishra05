Array Homework

1)Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and finds maximum number , it’s
index value.

2)Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and finds minimum number, it’s
index value.

3) Write a program which takes as input 2D- array and finds maximum number , it's
index value.

4) Write a program which takes as input 2D- array and finds minimum number, it's
index value.

5) Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and reverse an array.

6) 
6.1 Write a program which takes as input two 1D- array and find the sum of two
array and store results in new array.
Example: input : int [] a ={1,2,3,4};
int[] b = {10,20,30,40};
output : int [] c = {11,22,33,44};


6.2 Write a program which takes as input two 1D- array and find the difference of
two array and store results in new array.
Example: input : int [] a ={1,2,3,4};
int[] b = {10,20,30,40};
output : int [] c = {-9,- 18, -27,- 36};

7) Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and prints even numbers in the
array.

8) Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and prints odd numbers in the
array.

9) Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and prints positive numbers in
the array.

10) Write a program which takes as input 1D- array and prints negative numbers
in the array.

11) Write a program which takes as input 1D- array which contains first 25
numbers and prints prime numbers in the array.
prime nos: divisible by itself. Examples are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,13, 17,19, 23.
