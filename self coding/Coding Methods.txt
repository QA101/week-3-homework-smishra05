Note: output is a set of string so define your output type as “String”

public class Method1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(PrintNumber(5));
	}
	
	public static String PrintNumber(int n){
		String Final = “ “;
		for(int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++){
			Final = Final + “ “ + i;
		}

	return Final;
	}
